On 30 April, we're working together to make Open Educational Resources. Join us.

A range of teachers, librarians, academics, technologists, editors – and maybe even a few lawyers – will get together around the country to collaboratively make and adapt free, open educational resources.

These resources will then become available for *anyone* to access, adapt and reuse.

We want to grow a commons of open educational resources, so that every teacher in New Zealand has free and open access to all the resources they need, without having to ask permission or reinvent the wheel. Many of these resources already exist – the next step is to share them openly, so they can be used, adapted and improved, for the benefit of all.

Come along to the OER Sprints to:

- Make new resources from scratch; or
- Adapt and share your existing resources openly.

Learn more about the OER Sprints and Open Educational Resources.

**Open Educational Resources**

The aim of the Open Educational Resource (OER) sprint aims to make and adapt new OERs in a limited time-frame. Learn more about Open Educational 
Resources and the OER Sprints.

**Help organise the OER Sprints**

We're looking for people to help plan and run the events. If you want to help organise or host an event (or if you're just feeling nosy), 
you can join our open Loomio group.

**Sponsor the OER Sprints**

We're looking for national and local sponsors for the Open Educational Resource sprints. Whether you're a local or national organisation, 
if you're keen to help out, please get in touch.
