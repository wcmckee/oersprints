On 30 April, we're working together to make Open Educational Resources. Join us.

On 30 April, 2016, a range of teachers, librarians, academics, technologists, editors and maybe even a few lawyers will get together around the 
country to collaboratively produce free, open educational resources.

These resources will then become available for *anyone* to access, adapt and reuse.

We want to grow a commons of open educational resources, so that every teacher in New Zealand has free and open access to all the resources they need, without having to ask permission or reinvent the wheel. If you want to know more about open educational resources in New Zealand schools, you can read more here.

We'll be building on the success of similar projects, such as the Media Text Hack, in which a group of educators created a free and open Media 
Studies undergraduate textbook in a weekend (now an assigned textbook at the University of Otago).

Register your interest, and help us make open educational resources for kiwi educators.
